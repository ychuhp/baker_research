can select any element
if every chain has a minimal, then E e minimal
Yesterday this problem seemed so easy
But today I am struggling
What did i think of yesterday?

select an element suppose it is not minimal.
let B be the set of lower bounds for this element
consider all chains in this set B

Then for any chain it has a lower bound in the set B

Is there a way to reduce or combine chains?
Yes if they are linearly ordered
What if they are not linearly ordered?

Is it possible to impose some linear order?

Consider the set of all chains involving a
Call a chain less than another chain if it is contained
c1,c2,c3
